A production-ready network monitoring solution built with Python Flask that provides real-time visibility into network infrastructure health. This system monitors network switches via SSH, collects performance metrics, and displays them through an intuitive web dashboard with automated alerting capabilities.

##  Project Overview

This Network Monitoring System was developed to address the challenge of monitoring network infrastructure across a college campus with 18+ network switches. Traditional monitoring solutions like Zabbix require extensive setup and SNMP configuration on all devices. This lightweight alternative uses SSH connections to collect metrics directly from switches, making it faster to deploy and easier to maintain.

The system provides network administrators with:
- Real-time visibility into switch performance (CPU, memory, uptime)
- Automated alert generation for critical issues
- Historical data tracking for trend analysis
- Support for multiple switch vendors without additional configuration

**Real-world deployment:** Initially deployed on a campus VM to monitor production switches, now containerized and deployed on AWS EC2 with full CI/CD automation.

##  Key Features

- **SSH-Based Monitoring** - No SNMP configuration required; works with existing SSH access
- **Multi-Vendor Support** - Compatible with Cisco IOS/NX-OS, Aruba, TP-Link, D-Link, and Cambium switches
- **Real-Time Metrics** - Collects CPU usage, memory usage, uptime, and interface statistics
- **Automated Alerting** - Email notifications for critical events (switch down, high CPU/memory)
- **Web Dashboard** - Modern, responsive UI with real-time data visualization using Chart.js
- **Historical Data** - SQLite database stores metrics for trend analysis and troubleshooting
- **Configurable Thresholds** - Customizable alert thresholds for CPU, memory, and interface errors
- **Background Monitoring** - APScheduler runs automated polling every 120 seconds
- **Docker Support** - Fully containerized for consistent deployment across environments
- **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated testing and validation using GitHub Actions

##  CI Pipeline

This project implements a continuous integration pipeline using **GitHub Actions** that automatically validates every code change.

### Pipeline Workflow

**Trigger Events:**
- Push to `main` branch
- Pull requests to `main` branch

**Pipeline Steps:**
1. **Checkout Code** - Clones the repository
2. **Build Docker Image** - Builds the application container using the Dockerfile
3. **Run Container Test** - Starts the container and verifies the application launches successfully
4. **Log Validation** - Captures container logs to ensure no startup errors
5. **Cleanup** - Stops and removes test container

**Benefits:**
- Catches build failures before deployment
- Ensures Docker configuration is always valid
- Validates application startup process
- Provides confidence for production deployments

##  Deployment

### Cloud Deployment (AWS EC2 / Any Cloud VM)

The application is deployed using Docker Compose for easy management and scalability.

**Prerequisites:**
- Cloud VM with Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Open port 5000 (or configure reverse proxy)
